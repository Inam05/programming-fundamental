/*Write a C++ program that determines the eligibility of a candidate for a university admission based on the following criteria:
If the candidate's age is less than 18, display "Not eligible: Age criteria not met."
If the age is 18 or above, check the candidate's high school GPA.
If the GPA is less than 3.0, display "Not eligible: Insufficient GPA."
If the GPA is 3.0 or above, check the score in the entrance exam.
If the score is below 70, display "Not eligible: Low entrance exam score."
If the score is between 70 and 90 (inclusive), display "Eligible: Provisional admission."
If the score is above 90, display "Eligible: FullÂ admission."*/
